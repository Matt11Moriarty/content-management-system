# Content Management System

## Description

As an HR manager, it is difficult to manage all of my employees, job roles, and departments. 
We have a payroll database, but no way to interact with it!
That is why I created this `Content Management System` (CMS). Now, I am able to easily select the action I would like to complete, and the CMS will run the `SQL` automatically.

In creating this application, my knowledge of `MySql` as well as my ability to leverage asynchronous functions was forced to grow.
I was able to connect my server side application with a database, and leverage `MySql` to have the data pulled, or updated in some way.
